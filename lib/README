==   	  IoTivity Base (RICH & LITE) Stack & IoTivity Services       ==
===============================================================================
IOTIVITY repository (referred as "<iotivity>") is the top level directory which 
contains following features.

IoTivity Base:
The directory "resource" in IOTIVITY repository (referred as "<iotivity>")
contains two SDKs with underlying code (i.e. "stack"). The two SDKs are
referred to as "Rich Base SDK" (or "C++ SDK") and "Lite Base SDK" (or "C SDK"). The
associated stacks are referred to as "Rich Stack" (or "C++ Stack") and "Lite
Stack" (or "C Stack"), respectively. The Rich Stack-SDK pair requires that the
Lite Stack-SDK pair is built under it.

IoTivity Services:
The directory "service" in IOTIVITY repository (referred as "<iotivity>")
contains four services with underlying code. The services are referred as
Notification Manager, Protocol Plugin Manager, Soft Sensor Manager and
Things Manager.
===============================================================================

The Rich Stack is intended ONLY for Linux Ubuntu 12.04 operating system. To
build Rich Stack, please follow these requirements:
- GCC compiler version is 4.6
- Pre-install the "gnu-libc" libraries package.

The Lite Stack is intended ONLY for Linux Ubuntu 12.04, Arduino ATMega 2560
with Arduino Framework 1.0.5, and Arduino Due with Arduino Framework 1.5.7.
Tip: Use Cutecom in Ubuntu 12.04 to view logs from Arduino ATMega 2560 and
Arduino Due.

The Iotivity services are intended ONLY for Linux Ubuntu 12.04 operating system.
- GCC compiler version is 4.6
- Pre-install the "gnu-libc" libraries package.
- For Protocol Plugin Manager, tools such as Automake, Libtool, gettext, Expat,
	Libcurl are required.

To build Lite Stack, please follow these requirements for Linux Ubuntu 12.04:
- GCC compiler version is 4.6
- Pre-install the "gnu-libc" libraries package.

NOTE: The Arduino patches mentioned below are required to use the Arduino
Ethernet or WiFi shield.  They are not currently included in the IoTivity 
repository.  Please contact the IoTivity support forum for more information.

To build Lite Stack, please follow these requirements for Arduino ATMega 2560:
- Arduino Framework 1.0.5 is installed.
- AVR-GCC compiler version is 4.5.3 (Distributed with Arduino 1.0.5, no further
  action necessary if framework was obtained from
  http://arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases. Note: Frameworks obtained from
  apt-get have had different compiler versions.)
- Unzip the Time Library from here to your Arduino Directory Structure:
  http://playground.arduino.cc/code/time
- Apply patch "arduino-1.0.5_linux.patch" at <iotivity>/tools/arduino/patches
  to your Arduino Directory Structure at location <Arduino 1.0.5>.
- Create/Append "local.properties" file at location <iotivity>/resource/csdk/
  with the following specified:

  ARDUINO_DIR := <arduino-1.0.5>
  ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR := $(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/avr/bin

To build Lite Stack, please follow these requirements for Arduino Due:
- Arduino Framework 1.5.7 is installed.
- AVR-GCC compiler version is 4.8.3 (Distributed with Arduino 1.5.7, no further
  action necessary if framework was obtained from
  http://arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases. Note: Frameworks obtained from
  apt-get have had different compiler versions.)
- Unzip the Time Library from here to your Arduino Directory Structure:
  http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html
- Apply patch "arduino-1.5.7_linux.patch" at <iotivity>/tools/arduino/patches
  to your Arduino Directory Structure at location <Arduino 1.5.7>.
- Create/Append "local.properties" file at location <iotivity>/resource/csdk/
  with the following specified:

  ARDUINO_DIR := <arduino-1.5.7>
  ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR := $(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/avr/bin

Note: If you are building for Arduino Mega and building for Arduino Due you may
find it useful to set the "local.properties" file to look like this:

ifeq ($(PLATFORM), arduinomega)
	#Location of arduino sdk for Arduino Mega
	ARDUINO_DIR := <arduino-1.0.5>
	ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR := $(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/avr/bin
else
	#Location of arduino sdk for Arduino Due
	ARDUINO_DIR := <arduino-1.5.7>
	ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR := $(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4.8.3-2014q1/bin
endif

===============================================================================

Instructions for Common Build Processes:

Please use the following GNU make targets to build for the specific platform(s)
you wish to build. Please review "makefile" at the same directory level as this
README document to find the build output locations.

NOTE: 'GNU Make' is required to utilize the makefile at location:
<iotivity>/makefile.

NOTE: In release "M1" the build process only allows for single platforms to be
built at a time. For instance, you may only build successfully when building
either Lite modules for Arduino ATMega 2560, building Lite modules for Arduino Due,
or building Lite modules and/or Rich modules for Linux. Also, you may only build
either a RELEASE or a DEBUG revision at this time. Later releases will support
building for any and all platforms' modules with a single 'makefile' command.

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
