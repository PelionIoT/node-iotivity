@page AboutOIC About Open Interconnect Consortium

@section WhoAreWe Who are we?

\li We want to connect the next 25 billion devices for the Internet of Things.

\li We want to provide secure and reliable device discovery and connectivity across multiple OSs and platforms.

\li There are multiple proposals and forums driving different approaches... but no single solution addresses the majority of key requirements.

\li We need industry consolidation around a common, interoperable approach.

\li We need a broad industry consortium of companies to create a scalable solution.


@section WhyAreWeDoingThis Why are we doing this?

\li We are defining the specification, certification & branding to deliver reliable interoperability - a connectivity framework that abstracts complexity

\li This standard will be an open specification that anyone can implement and is easy for developers to use

\li It will include IP protection & branding for certified devices (via compliance testing) and service-level interoperability

\li There will also be an Open Source implementation of the standard

\li This Open Source implementation will be designed to enable application developers and device manufacturers to deliver interoperable products across Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Tizen, and more.

@section WhoNeedsThis Who needs this?

\li Consumers, Enterprise, Industrial, Automotive, Health, etc. who want smart devices to easily interconnect and communicate with appliances, embedded devices, etc.

\li Developers of operating systems, platforms, and applications who want their products to interoperate seamlessly across many brands and ecosystems.

\li End users who want consistent levels of security and identity across smart devices down to the smallest connected appliance

@section HowWillWeDeliverIt How will we deliver it?

\li Our goal is to define a comprehensive communications framework to enable emerging applications in all key vertical markets.

\li The framework must enable multiple new modes of communication, such as Peer-to-Peer, Mesh & Bridging, Reporting & Control, etc.

\li The framework should include a consistent implementation of identity, authentication and security across the modes of User ID, Enterprise / Industrial ID & Credentials.

\li It should include a sense of proximity for the Internet of Things and Wearable devices and include support for Onboarding and Provisioning.

\li And the framework must support a "building block" architecture and provide an Open Source implementation
